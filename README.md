Pet Adoption website for Software Engineering (CEN 4010)

The objective of this project was to create a full stack website. We used phpmyadmin for the UI of the SQL database for the back-end of the site, in addition to PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. 

The DOCUMENTATION.pdf file contains the requirement analysis description with the functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements, use case model, object model, dynamic models and screenshots of the UI.
